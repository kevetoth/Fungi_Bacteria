### 3/ Introduction. Why your project is interesting? & What is known already about it? Most citations should be done in the introduction. We chose this scientific paper because we were interested in the knowledge we could gain about the relationship between microorganisms and plants. A way to understand how the Growth of plants & physico chemical prop of the soil is influenced by different treatments.

What we know already : AMF - present to 70% of the terrestrial plants. Favorise exchange of nutrients/sugars thanks to arbuscules. Enhance resilience of plants for drought, heavy metals & pathogens. PGPR - include B (Bacillus sppâ€¦), contribute to the fixation of N, solubilisation of P, production of phytohormones & systemic resistance. AMF & PGPR provide ecological solutions to improve health soil & plants productivity.

### 4/ Objectives and hypotheses

The objectives are to analyse if arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi *AMF* & plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria *PGRB* have any synergy effects on nutrients uptakes or plant growth.

The hypothese are 1) AMF and PGPR could mutually symbiose and enhance the plant growth of Elymus nutans Griseb, & (2) the co-existence of AMF and PGPR could improve plant traits and soil quality better than their individual applications.
