# "Data" project

This is the final project for the subject "Data Acquisition Analysis and Scientific Methods for Life Sciences" shorted as "Data" from the first course of the Master Plant Health at the Universitat Politècnica de València.

In this project the students chose a scientific article and redo all possible statistic analyses and graphics from it, trying different approaches to see if they can improve them. They will use the data included in the article and follow the Material and methods chapter as a guide.

## Chosen article

[Cooperation between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth-promoting bacteria and their effects on plant growth and soil quality](https://peerj.com/articles/13080/)

## Proposal

To analyse if arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi *AMF* & plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria *PGRB* have any synergy effects on nutrients uptakes or plant growth.

We hypothesized that: (1) AMF and PGPR could mutually symbiose and enhance the plant growth of Elymus nutans Griseb, and (2) the co-existence of AMF and PGPR could improve plant traits and soil quality better than their individual applications.

Correlation analyses, ANOVA analyse, and some multivariate analyses.

We plan to start with each variable analyses separately then ANOVA analyses we'll combine these small results analyses with the knowledge acquire from the article chosen to define the larger scale multivariate analyses. These might be a relationship between soil nutrients/quality and plant size measurements (multiple roots measurements and above ground biomass).

You have a nice article to follow but data are a bit scarce. The dataframe have a lot of variables but not too many observations. Anyway it should be enough to do multivariate analyses to compare soil and plant compositions.
